The dataset on the Blackboard contains various measurements (i.e. size, center, etc) from thousands of bacterium under microscope. The last column with non-zero values indicate the bacterium are interesting enough for further study. Otherwise (i.e. last column with zero values), those bacterium are not interesting candidates for further study. Convert this dependent variable to binary values. Standardize predictors first using Z score. Write a MatLab (or a programming language of your choice) program to perform an analysis on this dataset using the Support Vector Machine method with the “RBF” kernel.  Answer the following questions: 1.What is the accuracy, Precision, and Recall for each class prediction? 2.Create an ROC curve plot for each class prediction.
